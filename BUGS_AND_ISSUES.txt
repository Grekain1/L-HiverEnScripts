---------------------1.1.1--------------------
Bugs:
- Missing audio dialouge when taking to Ignaz about experiments (NH talking to himself)
- Missing audio dialouge from Jack when asking about the harbour

Mistranslations:
- Dialouge when asking Lares to take escort NH; "Okay. Lets go" is "Okay. lass uns gehen."
- "Maybe later.." option when Thorben asks for gold to teach NH lockicking is wrong.
- When bribing Till for more gold to take care of Bronko the 50 gold level has teh wrong bottom option (they 
  are both the same)
