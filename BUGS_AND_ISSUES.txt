---------------------1.1.1--------------------
Bugs/Issues:
- Missing audio dialouge when taking to Ignaz about experiments (NH talking to himself)
- Missing audio dialouge from Jack when asking about the harbour
- Potential issue with enemy HP regen when they lose visbility of NH (esp. for ranged builds), 
  can just remove this part of coding from scripts. 
- Rod's Two Hander does not show weapon stats (range, str required) in description
- Remove Costantino's dialoges about Vatras healing
- Check why leather belt doesn't apply the bonuses with leather armor (Orlan one)
- A pirate in pirate's camp has STR 100 and tries to equip a 125 STR weapon, needs fix
- Books "Art of Smith" refer only for weapon skill

- Change how 1H talent is calculed when you equip 1h weapons and shields.
- Harad still gets annoyed with NH going into his house after becoming apprentice UNTIL player reloads 
  game. Any other NPC has the same behaviour.
  
  - Malcom and Owen quest got a problem, check this

Mistranslations:
- Dialouge when asking Lares to take escort NH; "Okay. Lets go" is "Okay. lass uns gehen."
- "Maybe later.." option when Thorben asks for gold to teach NH lockicking is wrong.
- When bribing Till for more gold to take care of Bronko the 50 gold level has teh wrong bottom option (they 
  are both the same)
- Reptile skin skill should have a better translation
