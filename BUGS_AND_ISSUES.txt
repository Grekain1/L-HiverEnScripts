---------------------1.1.1--------------------
Bugs/Issues:
- Missing audio dialouge when taking to Ignaz about experiments (NH talking to himself)
- Missing audio dialouge from Jack when asking about the harbour
- Potential issue with enemy HP regen when they lose visbility of NH (esp. for ranged builds), 
  can just remove this part of coding from scripts. 
- Harad still gets annoyed with NH going into his house after becoming apprentice UNTIL player reloads 
  game. 
- Rod's Two Hander does not show weapon stats (range, str required) in description

Mistranslations:
- Dialouge when asking Lares to take escort NH; "Okay. Lets go" is "Okay. lass uns gehen."
- "Maybe later.." option when Thorben asks for gold to teach NH lockicking is wrong.
- When bribing Till for more gold to take care of Bronko the 50 gold level has teh wrong bottom option (they 
  are both the same)
