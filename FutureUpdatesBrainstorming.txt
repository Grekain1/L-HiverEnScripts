# Gothic Free Aim script.
# Fix traders NPCs that equip the strongest weapon they have after NH talks to them the first time.
# Food recipes, some of them might be:
 - Fish soup, from Edda when you bring her 'Statue of Innos'
 - Stew, from Lobart's wife when you bring her 'Pan'
 - Ham, from the butcher of vanilla Gothic2 NoTR, when you complete his mission (Ham is made from raw meat and some other ingredients)
 - Meatbug stew,
# New NPC in Thieves guild and some new quests
  - Some stealing missions
  - Some assassination missions
  - New item 'Poison', (Poisoned weapons ?)
# New 'Stamina' statistic, based on your dexterity, it'll allow the player run till stamina hits 0. No other functions for now.
  - In this case 'Potion of speed' may become useless, it can be changed with 'Stamina potion' or something like that
